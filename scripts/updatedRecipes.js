    "ingredients": {
      "Crust": [
        "2 2/3 cups (368 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour",
        "1 1/2 Tablespoons granulated sugar",
        "1 1/2 tsp kosher salt",
        "1 1/2 cups (3 sticks, 342 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into 12 pieces",
        "3 egg yolks",
        "4 1/2 Tablespoons cold milk"
      ],
      "Filling": [
        "4 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced",
        "3 medium Macintosh apples, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced",
        "3/4 cup (165g) packed light brown sugar",
        "1/4 cup (35g) all-purpose flour",
        "1/4 tsp kosher salt",
        "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon",
        "1 egg, lightly beaten",
        "2 Tablespoons granulated sugar"
      ]
    },
    "directions": [
      "First, make the crust: Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the flour, sugar, and salt for 10 to 15 seconds, or until combined.",
      "Scatter the butter over the top. Mix on low speed for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or just until the flour is no longer bright white and holds together when you clump it and lumps of butter the size of pecans are visible throughout.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and milk. Add to the flour mixture all at once. Mix on low speed for about 30 seconds, or until the dough just barely comes together. It will look shaggy and more like a mess than a dough.",
      "Dump the dough onto an unfloured surface, the gather it together into a tight mound. Using your palm and starting on one side of the mount, smear the dough bit by bit, starting at the top of the mound and then sliding your plan down the side and along the work surface, until most of the butter chunks are smeared into the dough and the dough comes together. Do this once or twice on each part of the dough, moving throughout eh mound until the whole mess has been smeared into a cohesive dough with streaks of butter.",
      "Gather up the dough, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and press down to flatten into a disk about 1 inch thick. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours before using. The dough will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.",
      "Once the dough is sufficiently chilled, remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a well-floured work surface, flour out three-fourths of the dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. Reserve the remaining dough for the lattice top. Roll the dough circle around the pin and then unfurl it on top of a 9-inch pie pan. Press the dough gently into the bottom and sides of the pan and cut the overhanging edges so that there is a ¼ to ½ lip. Fold this under the and crimp around the circumference of the pie. Refrigerate the pie shell for at least 30 minutes, or tightly wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 1 day or freeze for up to 2 weeks. Bake directly from the refrigerator or freezer.",
      "Position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 350°F. Line the pie shell with parchment paper or several overlapping coffee filters and fill with pie weights. Blind bake for about 30 minutes, or until the entire shell is light brown.",
      "Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the apples, brown sugar, flour, salt, and cinnamon and toss to coat the apples evenly. Let sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This softens the apples so that you can pack more of them into the pie.",
      "When the pie shell is ready, remove it from the oven and leave the oven set at 350°F. Remove the weights and parchment, and pile the apples into the shell, pressing down lightly to compact them.",
      "On a well-floured work surface, roll out the remaining dough into a rectangle about 10 inches long by 6 inches wide and ¼ inch thick. Using a fluted pastry wheel or pizza wheel, cut lengthwise strips each about ¾ inch wide. Brush the strips with the beaten egg. Drape four of the dough strips on top of the apples, arranging them all in one direction and spacing them about 2 inches apart. Drape the remaining four dough strips at a 45-degree angle to the first four strips, again spacing them about 2 inches apart. Let the lattice strips drape over the edge of the pie shell (you will trim these after the pie bakes). Sprinkle the strips with the sanding sugar.",
      "Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes to 1 ½ hours, or until the lattice strips are golden brown all the way through. The apples should be soft and easy to pierce with a small knife. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before serving. Using a small knife to trim any lattice overhang, so the strips are flush with the pie edge. Serve warm or at room temperature. The pie can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 4 days."

Stir in blueberries, then milk, mixing only until large clumps form. Use your hands to reach inside the bowl and gently (so gently) knead the mixture into one mass. The more you knead, the wetter the dough will get as the blueberries break up, so work quickly and knead only a few times, if you can get away with it.",
      "Transfer dough to a well-floured counter and pat into a roughly 1-inch tall disc.

Simply spread the wedges on a baking sheet and chill until frozen solid and will no longer stick to each other, and pack tightly into a freezer bag. You can bake them right from the freezer; you'll only need 2 to 4 minutes extra baking time."

      "Add the ricotta and heavy cream together and stir them in to form a dough with a flexible spatula.Using your hands, gently knead dough into an even mass, right in the bottom of the bowl. Don't fret if the raspberries get muddled and smudge up the dough. This is a pretty thing.",
      "With as few movements as possible, transfer the dough to a well-floured counter, flour the top of the dough and pat it into a 5-inch square about 1-inch tall. With a large knife, divide the dough into 4 even squares. Transfer the scones to prepared baking sheet with a spatula. Bake the scones for about 15 minutes, until lightly golden at the edges. Cool in pan for a minute, then transfer to a cooling rack. It's best to cool them about halfway before eating them, so they can set a bit more. I know, way to be a big meanie, right?",
      "Do ahead: Scones are always best the day they are baked. However, if you wish to get a lead on them, you can make them, arrange them on your parchment-lined sheet and freeze them. If you're prepping just one day in advance, cover the tray with plastic wrap and bake them the day you need them. If you're preparing them more than one day in advance, once they are frozen, transfer them to a freezer bag or container. Bring them back to a parchment-lined sheet when you're ready to bake them. No need to defrost the froze, unbaked scones, just add 2 to 3 minutes to your baking time."

      "Turn the mixer to low again and add 1/3 of the dry ingredients, followed by 1/2 of the wet ingredients, then 1/3 of the dry, the other 1/2 of the wet, and the final 1/3 of the dry.

The first muffin tin will have six cavities filled and the second muffin will will have three cavities filled.

Sprinkle the top of each muffin with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar.",
      "Bake each muffin tin for 18 to 22 minutes, or until the muffins are domed and golden brown around the edges. A skewer inserted into the center of a muffin should come out with a few crumbs attached.",
      "Cool the muffins in their muffin tin on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then use an offset spatula to run underneath the edges of the blueberry muffin tops to prevent them from sticking in the pan. Be careful to just run the offset spatula under the edges - you don't want to accidentally decapitate the muffin from its top! After unsticking the muffin tops, keep cooling the muffins in the tins completely to room temperature. DO NOT TRY AND TURN THE MUFFINS OUT WHILE THEY ARE STILL WARM. Because these muffins are so top-heavy, you'll run the risk of accidentally pulling the tops and bottoms apart!",
      "Serve at room temperature. The muffins are best on the day that they're made, but can be individually wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days."
